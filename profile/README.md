## About

There are many ways to gain insight into the developer lifestyle.And none of them is as efficient as being a developer.This organisation
is geared to enhancing skills through peer collaboration and apprenticeship.

Here's why our members are zealous:
* Their time is focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* There are no repetitive tasks,once done methods become available for future use.
* implementing DIY ideas on the go and actualising them.

Of course, there will be strugggles but ain't that just technology.
